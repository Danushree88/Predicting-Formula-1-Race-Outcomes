# Predicting-Formula-1-Race-Outcomes
This project predicts Formula 1 race outcomes (1950–2024) using machine learning. It includes feature engineering (driver consistency, team strength, track complexity), model evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R²), and visual analysis of performance trends, pit strategies, and team dominance.
